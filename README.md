## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on experience completing the **MITRE Room** on TryHackMe. I explored adversary tactics and techniques using the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework, which is widely used by security teams around the world.



## 🛠️ Hands-On Skills Demonstrated

### Threat Actor Profiling
- Learned how to analyze threat actors using MITRE data
- Practiced interpreting threat intel reports

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework Navigation
- Used the ATT&CK Matrix to explore real-world attack tactics
- Studied techniques like `T1059`, `T1003`, `T1566` and more

### Mapping Threat Techniques
- Mapped adversary behavior from threat reports into MITRE techniques

### MITRE Navigator
- Used ATT&CK Navigator to build visual maps of attack techniques

### Real-World Application
- Connected LSASS memory dump behavior to `T1003.001`
- Understood how techniques align with incident response and SOC operations
